# Uid_Project - Personal Portfolio Website

This is a beginner-friendly responsive **HTML and CSS-only** personal portfolio project. It includes a homepage, about page, project showcase, and contact page — all custom styled without JavaScript or frameworks.

## 🔍 Overview

This portfolio is designed to present:
- A personal introduction
- Contact details with clickable social media icons
- Two featured projects (Project 1 and Project 2)
- A visually engaging design using background images, cards, and hover animations
- A **self-referential Portfolio Project**, listed on the homepage only

⚠️ The **Portfolio Project** (i.e., this portfolio itself) is featured on the **Home page** (`index.html`) as a project, but it is intentionally **excluded from the dedicated Projects section** (`projects.html`).
