    <h2>Blockchain Technology: A Beginner's Guide</h2>
    <p><em>By Niramay Madhav Narayan • March 19, 2025</em></p>
    <p>Blockchain is one of the most revolutionary technologies of the 21st century. Originally developed as the underlying system behind Bitcoin, blockchain has grown far beyond cryptocurrencies and now has the potential to transform industries from finance to healthcare.</p>
    
    <p>At its core, a blockchain is a decentralized digital ledger. Instead of storing data in a single location, it distributes copies across a network of computers. This means that no single entity controls the data, making it transparent, secure, and resistant to tampering.</p>
    
    <h3>Key Features of Blockchain</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Decentralization:</strong> No central authority controls the data. Everyone in the network shares responsibility.</li>
      <li><strong>Transparency:</strong> All transactions are recorded and visible to participants.</li>
      <li><strong>Security:</strong> Cryptography protects the data, and once added to the blockchain, information cannot be easily altered.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>Data is stored in "blocks", and each block contains a list of transactions. These blocks are linked in a chain—hence the name "blockchain". When a new block is created, it is added to the chain only after the network verifies and agrees on the data through a process called consensus.</p>

    <blockquote>"Blockchain is the tech. Bitcoin is merely the first mainstream manifestation of its potential." – Marc Kenigsberg</blockquote>
    
    <h3>Real-World Applications</h3>
    <p>Blockchain is being used in various ways beyond cryptocurrencies:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Supply chain tracking</li>
      <li>Digital identity verification</li>
      <li>Voting systems</li>
      <li>Smart contracts</li>
    </ul>

    <p>As the technology matures, it's likely we will see even more innovative use cases that could reshape how we interact with the digital world.</p>

    <p>Blockchain is still evolving, but its potential to build trust in a trustless environment is what makes it so exciting for the future.</p>
